A project in Web Development 

So now that sir has taught us the basics on how to use vue 
I have a feeling that all the code that we did before
is now obsolete
Which means that we sort of have to start over with
all the front-end code again
We can use the layout and some parts of the code as basis
but the overall implementation will have to be different

Hopefully we'll be able to do this bit by bit and finish 
it before the deadline
