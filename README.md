A project in Web Development 

Alright guys I have both folders one containing the files that are meant for backend and one for frontend
According to my understanding we'll most likely be using the backend folder to display our web app
and just insert the frontend stuff as components 

The files in old files are the frontend files that are in version 3 of vue. I am still trying to convert them into v2
